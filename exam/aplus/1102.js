        Question: "A technician installed a known-good, compatible motherboard on a new laptop. However, the motherboard is not working on the laptop. Which of the following should the technician MOST likely have done to prevent damage?",
        A: "Removed all jewelry",
        B: "Completed an inventory of tools before use",
        C: "Practiced electrical fire safety",
        D: "Connected a proper ESD strap",
        Correct: "D",
        Explanation: "The technician should have connected a proper ESD strap to prevent damage to the motherboard. ESD (electrostatic discharge) can cause damage to electronic components, and an ESD strap helps to prevent this by grounding the technician and preventing the buildup of static electricity. Removing all jewelry is also a good practice, but it is not the most likely solution to this problem."

        Question: "A technician receives a ticket indicating the user cannot resolve external web pages However, specific IP addresses are working. Which of the following does the technician MOST likely need to change on the workstation to resolve the issue?",
        A: "Default gateway",
        B: "Host address",
        C: "Name server",
        D: "Subnet mask",
        Correct: "A",
        Explanation: "The technician most likely needs to change the default gateway on the workstation to resolve the issue.

        Question: "A technician needs to recommend the best backup method that will mitigate ransomware attacks. Only a few files are regularly modified, however, storage space is a concern. Which of the following backup methods would BEST address these concerns?",
        A: "Full",
        B: "Differential",
        C: "Off-site",
        D: "Grandfather-father-son",
        Correct: "B",
        Explanation: "The differential backup method would best address these concerns. Differential backups only back up files that have changed since the last full backup, which means that only a few files would be backed up each time. This would help to mitigate the risk of ransomware attacks, as only a few files would be affected if an attack occurred. Additionally, differential backups require less storage space than full backups."

        C: "Rollback plan",
        D: "End user acceptance",
        Correct: "C",
        Explanation: "The rollback plan should be updated before requesting approval again. A rollback plan is a plan for undoing a change if it causes problems, and it is an important part of any change management process. If the change advisory board did not approve the requested change due to the lack of alternative actions if implementation failed, then updating the rollback plan would be the best way to address this concern."

        B: "Assign the ticket to the department's power user",
        C: "Register the ticket with a unique user identifier",
        D: "Provide the user with a unique ticket number that can be referenced on subsequent calls.",
        Correct: "D",
        Explanation: "The technician should provide the user with a unique ticket number that can be referenced on subsequent calls to make sure the ticket is associated with the correct user. This is because registering the ticket with a unique user identifier, having the user provide a callback phone number to be added to the ticket, or assigning the ticket to the department’s power user will not ensure that the ticket is associated with the correct user."

        D: "Set up a dual boot system by selecting the option to install Linux alongside Windows",
        Correct: "B",
        Explanation: "The user should install and run Linux and the required application as a virtual machine installed under the Windows OS. This solution would allow for parallel execution of the Linux application and Windows applications. The MOST efficient solution that allows for parallel execution of the Linux application and Windows applications is to install and run Linux and the required application as a virtual machine installed under the Windows OS. This is because it allows you to run both Linux and Windows together without the need to keep the Linux portion confined to a VM window."

The firewall settings control how the firewall filters and allows network traffic based on rules and policies. The firewall settings may be blocking or preventing the access to the internal site by mistake or by default, especially if the site uses a non-standard port number such as 8888. The technician should check and modify the firewall settings to allow the access to the internal site or its port number. Default gateway settings determine how a computer connects to other networks or the internet. Default gateway settings are not likely to cause the issue of not being able to access an internal site if the user can access the public internet. DHCP settings determine how a computer obtains its IP address and other network configuration parameters automatically from a DHCP server. DHCP settings are not likely to cause the issue of not being able to access an internal site if the user can access other network resources. IP address settings determine how a computer identifies itself and communicates with other devices on a network. IP address settings are not likely to cause the issue of not being able to access an internal site if the user can access other network resources. Antivirus settings control how the antivirus software scans and protects the computer from malware and threats. Antivirus settings are less likely to cause the issue of not being able to access an internal site than firewall settings, unless the antivirus software has its own firewall feature that may interfere with the network traffic."

        Explanation: "Flashing the BIOS, reformatting the drive, and then reinstalling the OS is the best method for returning a computer with a malware infection to service. Flashing the BIOS updates the firmware of the motherboard and can remove any malware that may have infected it. Reformatting the drive erases all data on it and can remove any malware that may have infected it. Reinstalling the OS restores the system files and settings to their original state and can remove any malware that may have modified them. Scanning the system with a Linux live disc may not detect or remove all malware infections. Degaussing the hard drive is an extreme method of destroying data that may damage the drive beyond repair.
