    A: "High availability",
    B: "Regionally diverse backups",
    C: "On-site backups",
    D: "Incremental backups",
    Correct: "B",
    Explanation: "Regionally diverse backups are backups that are stored in different geographic locations, preferably far away from the primary site. This way, if a disaster such as a hurricane or a power outage affects one location, the backups in another location will still be available and accessible. Regionally diverse backups can help ensure business continuity and data recovery in case of a disaster. The other options are not the best backup solutions for a site in an area that has frequent hurricanes and an unstable power grid. High availability is a feature that allows a system to remain operational and accessible even if one or more components fail, but it does not protect against data loss or corruption. On-site backups are backups that are stored in the same location as the primary site, which means they are vulnerable to the same disasters that can affect the primary site. Incremental backups are backups that only store the changes made since the last backup, which means they require less storage space and bandwidth, but they also depend on previous backups to restore data and may not be sufficient for disaster recovery."

    A: "Enterprise",
    B: "Pro for Workstation",
    C: "Home",
    D: "Pro",
    Correct: "A",
    Explanation: "Windows 10 Enterprise is an edition of Windows 10 that is designed for large organizations that need advanced security and management features. Windows 10 Enterprise can be activated using different methods, such as Multiple Activation Key (MAK), Active Directory-based Activation (ADBA), or Key Management Service (KMS). KMS is a method of activation that uses a local server to activate multiple devices on a network. KMS activations are valid for 180 days and need to be renewed periodically by connecting to the KMS server.

    Question: "A user rotates a cell phone horizontally to read emails, but the display remains vertical, even though the settings indicate autorotate is on. Which of the following will MOST likely resolve the issue?",
    A: "Recalibrating the magnetometer",
    B: "Recalibrating the compass",
    C: "Recalibrating the digitizer",
    D: "Recalibrating the accelerometer",
    Correct: "D",

    Question: "A large company is selecting a new Windows operating system and needs to ensure it has built-in encryption and endpoint protection. Which of the following Windows versions will MOST likely be selected?",
    A: "Home",
    B: "Pro",
    C: "Pro for Workstations",
    D: "Enterprise",
    Correct: "D",

    Question: "A user tries to access commonly used web pages but is redirected to unexpected websites. Clearing the web browser cache does not resolve the issue. Which of the following should a technician investigate NEXT to resolve the issue?",
    A: "Enable firewall ACLs.",
    B: "Examine the localhost file entries.",
    C: "Verify the routing tables.",
    D: "Update the antivirus definitions.",
    Correct: "B",
    Explanation: "A possible cause of the user being redirected to unexpected websites is that the localhost file entries have been modified by malware or hackers to point to malicious or unwanted websites. The localhost file is a text file that maps hostnames to IP addresses and can override DNS settings. By examining the localhost file entries, a technician can identify and remove any suspicious or unauthorized entries that may cause the redirection issue. Enabling firewall ACLs may not resolve the issue if the firewall rules do not block the malicious or unwanted websites. Verifying the routing tables may not resolve the issue if the routing configuration is correct and does not affect the web traffic. Updating the antivirus definitions may help prevent future infections but may not remove the existing malware or changes to the localhost file.

    Question: "A network technician installed a SOHO router for a home office user. The user has read reports about home routers being targeted by malicious actors and then used in DDoS attacks. Which of the following can the technician MOST likely do to defend against this threat?",
    A: "Add network content filtering.",
    B: "Disable the SSID broadcast.",
    C: "Configure port forwarding.",
    D: "Change the default credentials.",
    Correct: "D",
    Explanation: "One of the most effective ways to defend against malicious actors targeting home routers for DDoS attacks is to change the default credentials of the router. The default credentials are often well- known or easily guessed by attackers, who can then access and compromise the router settings and firmware. By changing the default credentials to strong and unique ones, a technician can prevent unauthorized access and configuration changes to the router. Adding network content filtering may help block some malicious or unwanted websites but may not prevent attackers from exploiting router vulnerabilities or backdoors. Disabling the SSID broadcast may help reduce the visibility of the wireless network but may not prevent attackers from scanning or detecting it. Configuring port forwarding may help direct incoming traffic to specific devices or services but may not prevent attackers from sending malicious packets or requests to the router.
