      Question: "Antivirus software indicates that a workstation is infected with ransomware that cannot be quarantined. Which of the following should be performed FIRST to prevent further damage to the host and other systems?",
      A: "Power off the machine.",
      B: "Run a full antivirus scan.",
      C: "Remove the LAN card.",
      D: "Install a different endpoint solution.",
      Correct: "A",
      Explanation: "Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts the files on a system and demands a ransom for their decryption. Ransomware can also spread to other systems on the network or exfiltrate sensitive data to the attackers. Therefore, it is important to isolate the infected machine as soon as possible to contain the infection and prevent further damage. Powering off the machine is a quick and effective way of disconnecting it from the network and stopping any malicious processes running on it. The other options are not directly related to preventing ransomware damage or may not be effective. Running a full antivirus scan may not be able to detect or remove the ransomware, especially if it is a new or unknown variant. Removing the LAN card may disconnect the machine from the network, but it may not stop any malicious processes running on it or any data encryption or exfiltration that has already occurred. Installing a different endpoint solution may not be possible or helpful if the system is already infected and locked by ransomware."

      A: "High availability",
      B: "Regionally diverse backups",
      C: "On-site backups",
      D: "Incremental backups",
      Correct: "B",
      Explanation: "Regionally diverse backups are backups that are stored in different geographic locations, preferably far away from the primary site. This way, if a disaster such as a hurricane or a power outage affects one location, the backups in another location will still be available and accessible. Regionally diverse backups can help ensure business continuity and data recovery in case of a disaster. The other options are not the best backup solutions for a site in an area that has frequent hurricanes and an unstable power grid. High availability is a feature that allows a system to remain operational and accessible even if one or more components fail, but it does not protect against data loss or corruption. On-site backups are backups that are stored in the same location as the primary site, which means they are vulnerable to the same disasters that can affect the primary site. Incremental backups are backups that only store the changes made since the last backup, which means they require less storage space and bandwidth, but they also depend on previous backups to restore data and may not be sufficient for disaster recovery."

      B: "Mirror",
      C: "Incremental",
      D: "Differential",
      Correct: "C",
      Explanation: "Incremental backup is a backup method that only backs up the files that have changed since the last backup, whether it was a full or an incremental backup. Incremental backup can save storage space and bandwidth, as it does not copy the same files over and over again. Incremental backup can also retain more versions of backups, as it only stores the changes made to the files. However, incremental backup can have longer restore times, as it requires restoring the last full backup and all the subsequent incremental backups in order to recover the data. The law firm is not concerned about restore times but asks the technician to retain more versions when possible, so incremental backup would be a suitable choice for them."

      Explanation: "One of the most effective ways to defend against malicious actors targeting home routers for DDoS attacks is to change the default credentials of the router. The default credentials are often well- known or easily guessed by attackers, who can then access and compromise the router settings and firmware. By changing the default credentials to strong and unique ones, a technician can prevent unauthorized access and configuration changes to the router. Adding network content filtering may help block some malicious or unwanted websites but may not prevent attackers from exploiting router vulnerabilities or backdoors. Disabling the SSID broadcast may help reduce the visibility of the wireless network but may not prevent attackers from scanning or detecting it. Configuring port forwarding may help direct incoming traffic to specific devices or services but may not prevent attackers from sending malicious packets or requests to the router.

      A: 'The device does not have enough free space to download the OS updates.',
      B: 'The device needs domain administrator confirmation to update to a major release.',
      C: 'The device is not compatible with the newest version of the OS.',
      D: 'The device is restricted from updating due to a corporate security policy.',
      Correct: 'D',
      Explanation: 'A corporate security policy can restrict a corporate-managed mobile device from updating its OS automatically, even if the auto-update feature is turned on. This can be done to prevent compatibility issues, security risks, or performance problems caused by untested or unwanted updates. The device not having enough free space, needing domain administrator confirmation, or being incompatible with the newest version of the OS are not likely causes of the issue, since the user would receive an error message or a notification in those cases.'
